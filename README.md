# EV

This work shows a parallel hybrid electric vehicle's performance at different drive cycles
using Matlab/Simulink. 

These drive cycles have different patterns, and the vehicle performance is reflected in the results such as engine speed, engine, electric power SOC,
Torque, and so on. 

A supporting analysis will be provided to corroborate the results in
Simulink with the Matlab calculator. 

Finally, a summary of the energy performance in all ofthe drive cycles is calculated
